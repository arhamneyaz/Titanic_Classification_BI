ML Project: Titanic Classification Cleaned dataset, EDA, and model testing. #DataScience #MachineLearning"


I want to highlight some key achievements and steps we've taken in this project:

🔍 Understanding the Dataset: We began by delving into the Titanic dataset, which provides information about passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, and more. This dataset is particularly interesting due to its historical context—the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic.

🧹 Data Preparation and Cleaning: Data quality is paramount. We performed data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicated data, and dropping unnecessary columns like 'PassengerId,' 'Name,' and 'Ticket.' These steps were essential to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.

📊 Data Visualization: Visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the data better. We visualized various aspects of the dataset, such as the distribution of passengers by sex and class, age distribution, and the impact of different factors on survival rates.

🎯 Objective Definition: Our primary objective was to build a predictive model that could answer the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" This involved creating a strong classification model.

🛠️ Model Building: We implemented several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and AdaBoost Classifier.

📈 Model Evaluation: For each model, we evaluated its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. This allowed us to determine how well each model predicted survival outcomes.

🏆 Top Performing Model: Our Decision Tree Classifier emerged as the top performer with an accuracy score of 77.78%. This model was closely followed by Logistic Regression and AdaBoost, each achieving an accuracy score of 76.67%.
